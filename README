Small php project to track incoming users by setting cookies from the landing page.
Place <?php include('wsdl/func.php'); tracking(); ?> at the top of each page you want to track.
Once the user contacts using a contact form the database will have the info needed to analyze the method similar to google analytics (direct, referral or search engine includes both organic and adwords)

Contact me if you'd like to contribute or have any questions.
